Hey coder!
So this is a project which was done along with my tutor on Udemy. 
This is a project which helped me know about css frameworks along with some animations using simple animations attributes
This page is completely responsive thanks to bootstrap components used.
This project is not enirely followed along as i thought some design elements would serve better for the website and hence, i went along with adding my own design elements and animations
